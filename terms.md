## 3. No Warranties – Use at Your Own Risk

All content and services are provided **“as is” and “as available”** without any warranties of any kind. Eytrix:

- Makes no guarantees that the services will be secure, error-free, or continuously available
- Disclaims all implied warranties, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement

Your use of the Services is entirely at your own risk.

## 4. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent allowed by law:

- **Eytrix and its affiliates, suppliers, and partners shall not be liable** for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
- This includes (but is not limited to) loss of data, profits, revenue, or business interruption — even if we were advised such damages might occur
- If we are found liable for any reason, **our total liability will not exceed the amount paid (if any) for the specific service giving rise to the claim**

This section survives the termination of your use of the Services.

While we strive to maintain up-to-date and accurate information:

- The content on the Eytrix website or platform may include **technical, typographical, or photographic errors**
- Eytrix does **not guarantee** that all materials are current, complete, or error-free
- We reserve the right to make changes at any time without notice

Our website and services may contain links to external sites or services that are **not owned or controlled by Eytrix**.

- We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or availability of any third-party websites

We may also notify you of material changes through email or in-app notifications.
