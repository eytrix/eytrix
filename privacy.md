# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what types of data we collect, why we collect it, how we store and use it, and how we protect your privacy. Our goal is to be transparent and ensure you fully understand how your information and video data are handled when you use our surveillance and safety systems.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect two major types of data: (1) information from our camera and monitoring systems, and (2) data related to the organizations and people using those systems.

### 1.1 Video Footage and Camera System Data

When you use our smart surveillance cameras, they generate a variety of information, including:

- **Live and Recorded Video:** Continuous or motion-triggered recordings from cameras, which are time-stamped so we know when each event occurred.  
- **Camera Settings and Diagnostics:** Data like the zoom level, focus, exposure settings, and temperature of the camera to help us troubleshoot problems.  
- **Automatic Alerts:** Events the system has flagged as unusual, such as motion detection, a person entering a restricted area, or environmental anomalies.  
- **System Logs:** Technical records of how the system is functioning — similar to a car’s black box, which logs what happened and when.

This data helps the system detect events, alert users, and keep a full record for future analysis or evidence.

### 1.2 Organizational and User Information

In addition to camera data, we collect some non-personal operational data, such as:

- **Entity Identifiers:** Names or IDs of the city, company, or agency using the system.  
- **User Login Activity:** Details about who accessed the system, when, and from where, including staff names, roles, and credentials.  
- **System Settings:** Custom rules users define — like when to trigger alerts or how long to store footage.  
- **Emergency Integrations:** Configuration data for how our system connects with 911, first responders, or municipal alert networks.

This information ensures the right people can access the system, and that it behaves the way the organization expects.

## 2. How and Where We Store Your Data

We store all collected data in highly secure, government-grade cloud servers located in the United States:

- **Main Storage Location:** AWS GovCloud (U.S.) — a secure cloud computing environment approved by U.S. federal agencies for handling sensitive data.  
- **Encryption:** All data is encrypted during transfer (like a sealed envelope in the mail) and while stored (like locking it in a vault).  
- **Access Controls:** Only authorized personnel can access data, and their access is logged and reviewed.  
- **Security Testing:** We regularly hire independent security experts to test our systems for weaknesses.

If you require your data to remain within specific legal jurisdictions (e.g., China or Switzerland), we offer alternate hosting options that comply with local data sovereignty laws.

## 3. How We Use Data to Improve Our AI

We use the video and system data to continuously improve our AI models — these are the software "brains" that help detect people, vehicles, events, and unusual activity. Our efforts include:

- **AI Training:** Using real-world footage to help the system learn to detect patterns (e.g., a person crossing a boundary, or an object being left behind).  
- **Improving Accuracy:** Testing how well the AI performs, and making it better over time by feeding it more examples.  
- **Feature Development:** Using data to create new capabilities, such as license plate recognition, intrusion detection, or crowd analysis.  
- **Quality Control:** Ensuring the system behaves reliably in different conditions, like night-time, fog, or crowded spaces.

We do **not** use the footage for unrelated advertising, social media, or commercial resale.

---

## 4. When We Use or Share Data — and Why

We may use or securely share data **only when necessary** and with proper safeguards in place. This may include:

- **Operating the System:** Letting users see live feeds or review incidents.  
- **Sending Alerts:** Delivering real-time notifications based on predefined rules (e.g., “send a text if someone enters this zone after 10 p.m.”).  
- **Connecting with Emergency Services:** Allowing fire, police, or rescue teams to see relevant footage if there is an emergency.  
- **Legal Compliance:** Providing video evidence if required by law enforcement, a subpoena, or a court order.  
- **System Optimization:** Using general patterns (not personal details) to improve system performance.

We **never sell** your data. We act only in ways that support safety, compliance, and system integrity.

---

## 5. How We Support Emergency Responders

If your system is integrated with first responders (like 911 or municipal agencies), we follow strict access and data-sharing rules:

- **Data Only Shared When Needed:** For example, if there's a fire or security incident.  
- **Minimal Access Principle:** Emergency responders see only what they need — no more.  
- **Full Tracking:** Every time someone accesses the system, a digital record is created (who, what, when, why).  
- **Legal Compliance:** We follow all applicable local, state, and federal rules for data sharing and storage in emergency contexts.

---

## 6. How Long We Keep Your Data

We retain all collected data **indefinitely by default** — meaning, we store it permanently unless your organization specifically requests deletion.

This long-term storage ensures:

- **Full historical visibility:** Authorized users can access past events for audits, investigations, or legal reviews.
- **Support for evidence handling:** Older data can serve as forensic or evidentiary material, especially in public safety and legal contexts.
- **Improved AI accuracy:** Long-term data sets help us fine-tune and validate detection models over time.

However, if your organization has specific data retention policies, we fully support custom configurations. You may instruct us to:

- Delete data after a set period (e.g., 30, 90, or 365 days)
- Anonymize data after initial review
- Purge data upon contract termination

Retention controls can be configured through your system’s administrative dashboard or by submitting a formal request to our support team.

Regardless of retention length, all data remains protected under our security, access control, and audit policies for as long as it is stored.

## 7. What You Can Do With Your Data

As an authorized user, you have rights and tools to manage the data associated with your account or organization:

- **View Your Data:** Access footage and system logs relevant to your role.  
- **Correct Errors:** If there’s incorrect information (e.g., wrong user details), you can submit a request to fix it.  
- **Download Data:** Export footage or logs in standard formats like CSV or JSON.  
- **Manage Access:** Control who in your organization can see or use certain features.  
- **Audit Logs:** View detailed activity records to know who accessed what and when — important for accountability and investigations.

---

## 8. The Laws We Follow

We take compliance seriously. Our service is designed to fully meet the requirements of:

- **Federal and State Privacy Laws:** Including surveillance and public safety regulations.  
- **Industry Standards:** Requirements for sectors like law enforcement, healthcare, and municipal operations.  
- **Risk and Privacy Frameworks:** We perform Privacy Impact Assessments and take steps to minimize risks.  
- **Cybersecurity Best Practices:** Our security controls align with standards like NIST, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP.

We review and update our practices regularly to stay current with the law.
